my vision with this project, was to vaguely resemble a part of my actions, when i was preparing the protest. i had a couple more scenes, but it got complicated really fast. artistically, i am really proud of the outcome, as it almost exactly resembles what i pictured in my head when i came up with this idea. technically, i also achieved what i sought out to do. i squashed many bugs when developing, and it is very well polished coding wise. i hope to maybe expand on it in the future!
