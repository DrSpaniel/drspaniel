COLLISION COURSE

using posenet (ml5.js), a ship is controlled by your torso.

there are 2 other files in this repository which arent used for this game. 
these were used to train and practice that the posenet model recognized my gestures properly.
to be honest the salute is still a bit jank. after a bunch of hours it still wasnt consistent. sorry.

trained model on 4 poses:
  1: salute (used to start the game) (A)    (this is needed so the model doesnt instantly restart when the game ends)
  2: steer left (t pose, lean left) (L)
  3: steer right (t pose, lean right) (R)
  4: rest pose (arms down) (E)

  known bugs:
  meteors do not spawn consistently
  gameplay texures are hideous and inconsistent compared to the intro screen. could be done better
  


  could be added:
  - shooting powerup
  - shield powerup
 -  tracking meteor, with arcing idek
 -  salute jank
