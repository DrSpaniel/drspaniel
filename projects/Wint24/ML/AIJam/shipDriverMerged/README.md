# shipDriver

ahh!!!!!! 
ship driver uses a combination of:

- a warped version of a project (space!!) i did last semester, that only moves horizontally
- poseDetector, so to detect a body and overlay a skeleton
- poseClassifier, so to define poses from 3 separate things: salute (to start game), left, and right.

coding train really rocks
